# Number-plate-detection-
This GitHub repository contains a real-time license plate detection project using OpenCV in Python. The application uses the Haar Cascade classifier to identify license plates from live video feed or pre-recorded videos and highlights them with bounding boxes. Detected license plates can also be saved as separate image files.
